//! What a run's settings ask of the lowering, as resolved values.
//!
//! Attractor lowers a DOT file; it reads no settings file of its own. A
//! host frontend that has one (Fabro's `workflow.toml`, `.fabro/project.toml`
//! and the user settings layer) resolves it into a [`RunSettings`] and hands
//! that to [`crate::lower`]. The default is a bare run: no model default, no
//! environment, no hooks, no MCP servers, the reference
//! compaction values, and a checkout of the bound repository.
